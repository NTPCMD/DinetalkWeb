    "paragraphs": [
      "DineTalk was born from a simple observation: restaurant owners were stretched too thin. During peak hours, phones would ring off the hook while staff juggled customers, orders, and bookings.",
      "Our founder, after years of working in hospitality and technology, recognized that AI could solve this problem. Not by replacing the human touch that makes restaurants special, but by handling the routine tasks that take time away from customers.",
      "Today, DineTalk serves restaurants across Australia, from bustling city cafés to coastal fine dining establishments. We're proud to be part of the hospitality community, helping businesses thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.",
      "Based in Perth, Western Australia, we're passionate about supporting local restaurants and contributing to the vibrant food scene that makes Australia special."
